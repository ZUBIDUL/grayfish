Grayfish is a static website generator for DocBook XML documents.


Overview
--------

Grayfish is a website generator, which generats static HTML files from
each DocBook XML documents as an integrated content.

[DocBook](https://docbook.org/) is a large XML schema for technical
documentation. The documents written in DocBook is machine readable
and you can apply reliable XML tools and technologies to them.

On the other hand, to organize or integrate these documents as a
integrated content was so hard. For example, publishing RSS/Atom feeds
or displaying `rescently update articles' on your site needs the other
tools outside the DocBook technology.

Grayfish helps you to build an integrated website from separated
documents statically.
